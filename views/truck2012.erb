<div class="header_box"><div>BAMRU 2012 Truck Campaign</div></div>

<div class="content">

  We urgently need to replace our aging rescue truck with a 3/4 ton
  or larger 4x4 pickup or 4x4 van.  We welcome donations for its
  replacement, OR cash donations to help us purchase a replacement vehicle.
  <p></p>

  Our current 2WD truck has more than 200,000 miles.  This vehicle is our
  mobile equipment cache, and is critical for our operations.  Our goal
  is find a replacement by mid-2013.
  We have launched a campaign to raise $75,000
  for a new truck purchase.
  <p></p>

  Please consider making a tax-deductible contribution to the BAMRU truck fund.

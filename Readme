This is a mockup of a simple BAMRU Website app.
-----------------------------------------------

Live Demo
---------
To see a live demo, visit
http://btest.alt55.com/calendar.test

All of the demo uses dynamically generated pages
and a shared layout.  This means the site is
easier to maintain.

If you want to compare the dynamically generated
page to the original static page, just change the
url from '.test' to '.html' in your browser.

Installing & Running the App
----------------------------
This is going to work best on Linux or Mac.
Windows hasn't been tested.

1) sudo apt-get install ruby git
2) gem install bundler
3) git clone https://github.com/andyl/BAMRU-Public

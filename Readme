This is a mockup of a simple BAMRU Website app.
-----------------------------------------------

Live Demo
---------

To see a running version of the app, visit
http://btest.alt55.com

All of the demo is now using dynamically generated
pages and a shared layout.  This means the site is
considerably easier to maintain.

If you want to compare the dynamically generated
page to the original static page, just type '.html'
at the end of the page url in your browser.

Editing the App
---------------

1) Fork/Clone the repo.

2) Run 'bundle install' to install the support software.

2) Run 'rake -T' to see a list of test / edit commands.

2) Run 'cap -T' to see a list of deployment commands.

This is a mockup of a simple BAMRU Website app.
-----------------------------------------------

Live Demo
---------
To see a live demo, visit
http://btest.alt55.com/calendar.test

All of the demo uses dynamically generated pages
and a shared layout.  This means the site is
easier to maintain.

If you want to compare the dynamically generated
page to the original static page, just change the
url from '.test' to '.html' in your browser.

Installing & Running the App
----------------------------
This is going to work best on Linux or Mac.
Windows hasn't been tested.

Installing the Server:
1) install ruby, git, rubygems
2) > gem install bundler
3) > git clone https://github.com/andyl/BAMRU-Public
4) > cd BAMRU-Public
5) > bundle install
6) > rake run_server

Running the App:
1) start your browser
2) visit http://localhost:9393

Editing/Updating the App
------------------------
Please include tests with any update you make.
Run 'rake -T' to see a list of test/edit commands.

Deploying the App
-----------------
All of the deployment scripts are in the Capfile.
Run 'cap -T' to see a list of deployment commands.

Administration and Security
---------------------------
The admin page allows approved users to update calendar
events on the website.  The admin page is password 
protected.  The password is set at install time, 
and is not stored in the source code repository.
The password can be updated by running the task
'cap password'.

module VirtualBox
  class AbstractModel
    # Module which can be included into any other class which allows
    # that class to have attributes using the "attribute" class method.
    # This creates the reader/writer for the attribute but also provides
    # other useful options such as readonly attributes, default values,
    # and more.
    #
    # Make sure to also see the {ClassMethods}.
    #
    # ## Defining a Basic Attribute
    #
    #     attribute :name
    #
    # The example above would put the "name" attribute on the class. This
    # would give the class the following abilities
    #
    #     instance.name = "Harry!"
    #     puts instance.name # => "Harry!"
    #
    # Basic attributes alone are not different than ruby's built-in
    # `attr_*` methods.
    #
    # ## Defining a Readonly Attribute
    #
    #     attribute :age, :readonly => true
    #
    # The example above allows age to be read, but not written to via the
    # `age=` method. The attribute is still able to written using
    # {#write_attribute} but this is generally only for
    # inter-class use, and not for users of it.
    #
    # ## Defining Default Values
    #
    #     attribute :format, :default => "VDI"
    #
    # The example above applies a default value to format. So if no value
    # is ever given to it, `format` would return `VDI`.
    #
    # ## Attributes for a Specific VirtualBox Version
    #
    # Attributes change with different VirtualBox versions. One way to
    # provide version-specific behavior is to specify the version
    # which the attribute applies to.
    #
    #     attribute :name, :version => "3.2"
    #     attribute :age, :version => "3.1"
    #
    # These versions only apply to major and minor releases of
    # VirtualBox. Patch releases can't be specified (such as "3.2.4")
    #
    # ## Populating Multiple Attributes
    #
    # Attributes can be mass populated using {#populate_attributes}. Below
    # is an example of the use.
    #
    #     class Person
    #       include Attributable
    #
    #       attribute :name
    #       attribute :age, :readonly => true
    #
    #       def initialize
    #         populate_attributes({
    #           :name => "Steven",
    #           :age => 27
    #         })
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # **Note:** Populating attributes is not the same as mass-updating attributes.
    # {#populate_attributes} is meant to do initial population only. There is
    # currently no method for mass assignment for updating.
    #
    # ## Custom Populate Keys
    #
    # Sometimes the attribute names don't match the keys of the hash that will be
    # used to populate it. For this purpose, you can define a custom
    # `populate_key`. Example:
    #
    #     attribute :path, :populate_key => :location
    #
    #     def initialize
    #       populate_attributes(:location => "Home")
    #       puts path # => "Home"
    #     end
    #
    # ## Lazy Loading Attributes
    #
    # While most attributes are fairly trivial to calculate and populate, sometimes
    # attributes may have an expensive cost to populate, and are generally not worth
    # populating unless a user of the class requests that attribute. This is known as
    # _lazy loading_ the attributes. This is possibly by specifying the `:lazy` option
    # on the attribute. In this case, the first time (and _only_ the first time) the
    # attribute is requested, `load_attribute` will be called with the name of the
    # attribute as the parameter. This method is then expected to call `write_attribute`
    # on that attribute to give it a value.
    #
    #     class ExpensiveAttributeModel
    #       include VirtualBox::AbstractModel::Attributable
    #       attribute :expensive_attribute, :lazy => true
    #
    #       def load_attribute(name)
    #         if name == :expensive_attribute
    #           write_attribute(name, perform_expensive_calculation)
    #         end
    #       end
    #     end
    #
    # Using the above definition, we could use the class like so:
    #
    #     # Initializing is fast, since no attribute population is done
    #     model = ExpensiveAttributeModel.new
    #
    #     # But this is slow, since it has to calculate.
    #     puts model.expensive_attribute
    #
    #     # But ONLY THE FIRST TIME. This time is FAST!
    #     puts model.expensive_attribute
    #
    # In addition to calling `load_attribute` on initial read, `write_attribute`
    # when performed on a lazy loaded attribute will mark it as "loaded" so there
    # will be no load called on the first request. Example, using the above class
    # once again:
    #
    #     model = ExpensiveAttributeModel.new
    #     model.write_attribute(:expensive_attribute, 42)
    #
    #     # This is FAST, since "load_attribute" is not called
    #     puts model.expensive_attribute # => 42
    #

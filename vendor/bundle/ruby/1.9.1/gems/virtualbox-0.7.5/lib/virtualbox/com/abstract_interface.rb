    # Base class for a COM (component object model) interface class. This
    # abstraction is necessary to maintain a common ground between
    # Windows COM usage and the VirtualBox C API for unix based systems.
    #
    # # Defining an Interface
    #
    # Defining an interface is done by subclassing AbstractInterface and
    # using the provided class methods to define the COM methods and
    # properties. A small example class is shown below:
    #
    #     class Time < AbstractInterface
    #       function :now, [[:out, :uint]]
    #       property :hour, :uint
    #     end
    #
    # # Accessing an Interface
    #
    # Interfaces are never accessed directly. Instead, an {InterfaceRunner}
    # should be used. Depending on the OS of the running system, the VirtualBox
    # gem will automatically either load the MSCOM interface (on Windows)
    # or the XPCOM interface (on Unix). One loaded, interfaces can simply be
    # accessed:
    #
    #     # Assume `time` was retrieved already
    #     puts time.foo.to_s
    #     time.hour = 20
    #     x = time.now
    #
    # The above example shows how the properties and functions can be used
    # with a given interface.
    #

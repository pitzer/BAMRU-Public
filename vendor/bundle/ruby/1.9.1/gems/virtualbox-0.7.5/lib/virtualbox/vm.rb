module VirtualBox
  # Represents a single VirtualBox virtual machine. All attributes which are
  # not read-only can be modified and saved.
  #
  # # Finding Virtual Machines
  #
  # Two methods are used to find virtual machines: {VM.all} and {VM.find}. Each
  # return a {VM} object. An example is shown below:
  #
  #     vm = VirtualBox::VM.find("MyWindowsXP")
  #     puts vm.name # => "MyWindowsXP"
  #
  # # Modifying Virtual Machines
  #
  # Virtual machines can be modified a lot like [ActiveRecord](http://ar.rubyonrails.org/)
  # objects. This is best shown through example:
  #
  #     vm = VirtualBox::VM.find("MyWindowsXP")
  #     vm.memory_size = 256
  #     vm.name = "WindowsXP"
  #     vm.save
  #
  # # Controlling Virtual Machines
  #
  # Virtual machines can be controlled using the basic {#start}, {#stop}, etc.
  # methods. The current state of the VM can also be retrieved via the {#state}
  # method. An example of this use is shown below:
  #
  #     if vm.powered_off?
  #       vm.start
  #     end
  #
  # # Taking a Snapshot
  #
  # Snapshots allow virtual machine states to be saved at a given point in time
  # without having to stop the machine. This state can then be restored later.
  # VirtualBox handles this by creating a differencing image which allows the hard
  # drive to even retain its exact state. Taking a snapshot is extremely simple:
  #
  #     vm = VirtualBox::VM.find("MyWindowsXP")
  #     vm.take_snapshot("My Snapshot", "A description of my snapshot")
  #
  # # Traversing Snapshots
  #
  # Snapshots are represented by a tree-like structure. There is a root snapshot
  # and that snapshot has many children which may in turn have their own children.
  # The easiest way to traverse this structure is to use the {#root_snapshot}
  # VM method and traverse the structure like any tree structure:
  #
  #     vm = VirtualBox::VM.find("MyWindowsXP")
  #     p vm.root_snapshot.children.length
  #
  # # Finding Snapshots
  #
  # While traversing the entire snapshot tree can be useful, it is often more
  # useful to be able to simply find a snapshot by name. For this, use the
  # {#find_snapshot} method:
  #
  #     vm = VirtualBox::VM.find("MyWindowsXP")
  #     p vm.find_snapshot("PreSP3")
  #
  # # Attributes and Relationships
  #
  # Properties of the virtual machine are exposed using standard ruby instance
  # methods which are generated on the fly. Because of this, they are not listed
  # below as available instance methods.
  #
  # These attributes can be accessed and modified via standard ruby-style
  # `instance.attribute` and `instance.attribute=` methods. The attributes are
  # listed below.
  #
  # Relationships are also accessed like attributes but can't be set. Instead,
  # they are typically references to other objects such as a {HardDrive} which
  # in turn have their own attributes which can be modified.
  #
  # ## Attributes
  #
  # This is copied directly from the class header, but lists all available
  # attributes. If you don't understand what this means, read {Attributable}.
  #
  #     attribute :uuid, :readonly => true, :property => :id
  #     attribute :name
  #     attribute :os_type_id

  # ## Relationships
  #
  # In addition to the basic attributes, a virtual machine is related
  # to other things. The relationships are listed below. If you don't
  # understand this, read {Relatable}.

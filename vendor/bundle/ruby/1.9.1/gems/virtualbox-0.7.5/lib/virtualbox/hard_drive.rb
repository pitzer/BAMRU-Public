module VirtualBox
  # Represents a hard disk which is registered with VirtualBox.
  #
  # # Finding a Hard Drive
  #
  # Hard drives can be found use {HardDrive.all} and {HardDrive.find}, which
  # find all or a specific hard drive, respectively. Example below:
  #
  #     VirtualBox::HardDrive.all
  #
  # Or use find with the UUID of the HardDrive:
  #
  #     VirtualBox::HardDrive.find("4a896f0b-b3a3-4dec-8c26-8406c6fccd6e")
  #
  # # Creating a Hard Drive
  #
  # Hard Drives can be created by intilizing an empty hard drive, assigning
  # values to the necessary attributes, and calling save on the object.
  # Below is a simple example of how this works:
  #
  #     hd = VirtualBox::HardDrive.new
  #     hd.format = "VDI" # Or any format list with `VBoxManage list hddbackends`
  #     hd.location = "foo.vdi"
  #     hd.size = 2400 # in megabytes
  #     hd.save
  #
  #     # You can now access other attributes, since its saved:
  #     hd.uuid
  #     hd.location # will return a full path now
  #
  # # Destroying Hard Drives
  #
  # Hard drives can also be deleted. **This operation is not reversable**.
  #
  #     hd = VirtualBox::HardDrive.find("...")
  #     hd.destroy
  #
  # This will only unregister the Hard Drive from VirtualBox and will not destroy
  # the storage space on the disk. To destroy the storage space, pass `true` to
  # the destroy method, example:
  #
  #     hd.destroy(true)
  #
  # # Cloning Hard Drives
  #
  # Hard Drives can just as easily be cloned as they can be created or destroyed.
  #
  #     hd = VirtualBox::HardDrive.find("...")
  #     cloned_hd = hd.clone("bar.vdi")
  #
  # In addition to simply cloning hard drives, this command can be used to
  # clone to a different format. If the format is not passed in (as with the
  # the above example, the system default format will be used). example:
  #
  #     hd = VirtualBox::HardDrive.find("...")
  #     hd.clone("bar.vmdk", "VMDK") # Will clone and convert to VMDK format
  #
  # # Attributes
  #
  # Properties of the model are exposed using standard ruby instance
  # methods which are generated on the fly. Because of this, they are not listed
  # below as available instance methods.
  #
  # These attributes can be accessed and modified via standard ruby-style
  # `instance.attribute` and `instance.attribute=` methods. The attributes are
  # listed below. If you aren't sure what this means or you can't understand
  # why the below is listed, please read {Attributable}.
  #
  #     attribute :format, :default => "VDI"
  #     attribute :location
  #     attribute :logical_size
  #     attribute :physical_size, :readonly => true, :property => :size
  #
  # There are more attributes on the {Medium} model, which {HardDrive} inherits
  # from.

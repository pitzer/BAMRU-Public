# A super simple ordered hash implementation. This class probably
# isn't useful outside of these testing scripts, since only the bare
# minimum is implemented.
#
# The ordered hash is implemented by keeping the key/values in an
# array where each element is an array of format [key,value]. This
# forces the keys to be in the proper order, paired with their
# values.
